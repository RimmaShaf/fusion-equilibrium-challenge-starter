"""Metric reduction: pooled R2 for the flux map, the two value scalars, and the eight
consistency scalars, plus the composite S (metric v2).

All R2 here are *pooled* (a single ratio-of-sums over every element of a machine's test set),
not per-shot averages. To make that streamable, the reference bundle precomputes the total sum
of squares from ground truth alone (SS_tot) -- for the value scalars over the stored EFIT
labels, for the consistency scalars over f_j(psi_gt) -- and each shot worker only accumulates
the residual sum of squares SS_res from its own predictions; the parent forms
R2 = 1 - SS_res / SS_tot. A perfect psi therefore scores R2_psi = 1, D_LCFS = 0 and every
R2_cons_j = 1 by construction.

Sign invariance (v3.1): the fold's global flux sign is chosen ONCE, by the probe pass in
parallel.score_config, and imposed on every shot before any of this runs -- so `finalize_machine`
reads it off the accumulator rather than choosing it. Workers still report SS_res under both
signs, but only so the report can show what the submission would have scored unflipped. Being a
single fold-global bit is what makes it ungameable: a submission cannot pick a favourable sign
per shot, and one bit chosen over ~10^8 pixels carries no exploitable noise.
