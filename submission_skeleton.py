Submission skeleton — a runnable, format-correct example of a challenge submission.

This is the executable version of README → "3. What you predict". Run it and read the
printed shapes to see exactly what a submission looks like — no Git LFS / sample data needed
(it streams the public test inputs from Hugging Face).

What you submit (per shot, at each `efit_times` timestamp), grouped per shot in one .npz per config:
    shot_0000_psirz    (T, H, W)   flux map   DIII-D 65x65 / MAST 65x65 (both dense, no NaN region)
    shot_0000_q95      (T,)        edge safety factor
    shot_0000_betaN    (T,)        normalized beta

That is the WHOLE contract (metric v2): the flux map plus the only two scalars a flux map cannot
contain (q95 needs the toroidal field function F(psi), betaN needs the pressure profile p(psi)).
Everything else — the LCFS boundary, magnetic axis (R_axis/Z_axis), elongation, triangularity,
volume and internal inductance (li) — is DERIVED from your submitted
flux map by the scorer, with the same published functionals it applies to the ground-truth flux.
A scalar can only be earned by a psi that implies it: there is no separate scalar head to tune.

The leaderboard score is the composite
    S = 0.55*R2_psi + 0.15*R2_{q95,betaN} + 0.10*(1 - D_LCFS) + 0.20*Consistency
where Consistency is the mean agreement of the seven psi-derived scalars, f(psi_pred) vs
f(psi_gt). A perfect flux map scores D_LCFS = 0 and Consistency = 1 by construction.

To make a real submission, replace `your_model_predict()` with your trained model. The placeholder
here emits zeros of the correct shape (a valid-but-useless submission) so you can confirm the
plumbing before plugging in a model.

This one script does the whole submission: build -> validate -> push to Hugging Face -> write the
zip you upload to Codabench.

    # quick format check, 5 shots, build only
    uv run python submission_skeleton.py --max-shots 5

    # the real thing: every shot, pushed, with submission_pointer.zip ready to upload
    uv run python submission_skeleton.py --max-shots 0 \
        --repo your-username/fusion-eq-predictions --read-token hf_...

Run it once without --read-token to create the repo; Hugging Face cannot scope a token to a repo
that does not exist yet. See README -> "5. Build and submit".

      - `thomson_*` = kinetic profiles (electron temperature & density).
      - `efit_times` (+ MAST: `efit_grid_R/Z`).
    The targets are withheld in test configs. `magnetics_dsep` is EFIT-DERIVED (computed from
    the target equilibrium) and is neither an input nor a scored target. Also available as
    inputs: `coil_*` (PF-coil positions/turns, joined to the current columns by
    `coil_input_column`) and `thomson_chord_R/Z` (chord positions). Focus on making psi(R,Z)
